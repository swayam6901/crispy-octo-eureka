gym jaata hai mirror ko disappoint karne
ke jokes itne thande ki AC jealous ho jaaye
jab plan banata hai, universe laugh track daal deta hai
ka style loading mein, result missing hai
ka confidence wifi jaisa he kabhi chalu, mostly gone
dream karta hai bina alarm ke
ke vibes buffering mode mein stuck hain
selfie ke liye born hua, reality ke liye nahi
ka logic office se chhutti pe hai
flirt karta hai jaise outdated app update maang raha ho
ka marks aur excuses ka ratio perfect hai—zero by infinity
sirf motivation quotes padhta hai par apply kabhi nahi karta
ke goals aur efforts long-distance relationship mein hain
reality mein beta version hi reh gaya
ke jokes pe silence bhi awkward feel karta hai
attitude aesa dikhata hai jaise sponsor mil gaya ho
ke crush ne usse archive kar diya, unfriend bhi nahi
multitask nahi, multi-fail karta hai
Tere plans tera love life jaise he start hi nahi hote
hero banna chahta tha, meme ban gaya
ka hairstyle aur life dono uneven hain
love story likhta hai, ending me tragedy auto-fill hoti hai
life mein shortcut dhundta hai, result long delay milta hai
ke efforts background app jaise he humesha minimize
mirror mein dekhke bhi disappointed hota hai
ka swag trial version mein expire ho gaya
ka actions aur captions opposite direction mein hain
gym gaya tha, par protein shake bhi udaas ho gaya
ke jokes pe Siri bhi silent ho gayi
excuse generator certified edition hai
ke marks aur confidence ek hi graph pe niche ja rahe hain
logic se zyada filters use karta hai
ka luck aur timing dono rival gang hain
reality show nahi, blooper reel hai
ke crush ne usse friendzone nahi, recycle bin mein daala hai
self-obsessed itna hai ki mirror bhi therapy chahta hai
yeh coaches dont play bolke love guru banna chahta he
energy saving mode permanent on hai
inspiration ke naam pe disappointment deliver karta hai
confidence post karta hai, par real life mein draft rehta hai
ka phone smart hai, tu nahi
goals set karta hai, alarm kabhi ring nahi karta
ke vibes “low battery” alert hain
ambition likhta hai, par spelling wrong hoti hai
ke jokes pe teacher bhi attendance cancel kar de
bold caption likhta hai, par life italic hai
struggle kar raha hai par result “coming soon” pe atka hai
ke plans aur luck opposite shifts mein kaam karte hain
effort se zyada excuses upload karta hai
ke crush ke replies aur tera future dono pending hain
Tu overthink nahi karta (Dimag not found 404)
ke dreams aur tu ek hi file mein corrupt ho
attention chaahta hai, par logic ignore karta hai
ke ideas error 404 pe rehte hain
life mein hero nahi, loading screen hai
ke goals deadline ke saath hide and seek khelte hain
attitude dikhata hai, par result hide karta hai
ke hopes aur reality same frequency pe kabhi tune nahi hote
khud quote karta hai “never give up” par try bhi nahi karta
ke jokes pe dog bhi side-eye de
 online rehta hai par mentally offline
ke crush ne usse contact list se notes app mein daal diya
apne hi motivation se bored hai
ke efforts invisible mode mein hain
flirting karta hai jaise spam message ho
ka luck airplane mode mein chala gaya
mirror se ladta hai par reflection jeet jaata hai
ke dreams ne tujhe pending request mein daal diya hai
ka reality check out of stock hai
 life ke trailer mein atka hai, jisski movie kabhi release nahi hoti
ke goals aur excuses same playlist mein hain
future ka plan karta hai par present pe snooze hai
ke crush ne usse “maybe later” folder mein daal diya hai
motivation ke naam pe meme bhejta hai
ke ideas thakte hain tere sochne se pehle
ke vibes “try again later” mode mein hain
ke jokes pe background music bhi awkward ho jaata hai
apne me talent search karta hai jaise lost item
ke goals aur luck ek hi train miss kar gaye
hero banna chahta hai par timing villain wali hai
ke actions buffering mein hain, excuses full HD
ke crush ke liye woh “low priority task” hai
apne confidence ka unpaid intern hai
ke jokes pe Google bhi suggestion band kar deta hai
inspiration dekh ke bhi demotivate ho jaata hai
ke dreams aur reality long-distance mein hain
risk nahi leta, excuses se pyaar karta hai
ke actions “coming soon” trailer pe stuck hain
motivation ke naam pe procrastination karta hai
ke crush ke liye woh optional subject hai
luck ke saath ek-sided relationship mein hai
ke jokes pe even silence bhi leave kar de
ke goals ne usse “remind me later” pe daal diya
mirror ke liye unpaid horror show hai
ke dreams ke liye woh loading symbol ban gaya
vibe karne jaata hai, par universe ko cringe lagta he
ke ideas se zyada usska overconfidence outdated hai
caption likhne mein topper hai, action mein backbencher
